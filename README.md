# Question 1

These tools are important because they are all give you the basic skills to edit and create a website.

- The terminal provides you with a place to edit, make, and access files for your website and other things.

- Github helps you create and manage a website outside of terminal as well as providing a community to get code from.

- vim gives you easy hotkeys and easy ways to edit files.

- Markdown helps you format and organize your code and website.
 
# Question 2

I am feeling good about this new technology. I have gotten most it down relatively quickly, with only a few hiccups along the way. 

# Question 3

As advice for future students, I would say make sure you miss none of the steps at all, like double check. This is especially important while setting things up for the first time as missing one step could mess it all up, even it you don't notice it then.
