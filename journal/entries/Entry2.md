### Question 1:
The difference between symmetric and asymetric encyption is that symmetric encyrption uses the same key for both encyption and decryption, asymmetric uses two different keys for each part.

### Question 2:
The steps of the encryption and decryption process are that a key is generated, the key is used to encrypt a message. Then, message is put out and the reciver uses either same key or a different, private key to decode it.  The reciver can then read the now decoded message.

### Question 3:
It is important that you never share your secret key because if someone steals your key, they can read your messages, distribute malware, im
personate you, etc.
