## "Hope the king doesn't fall ill."

### Genre:

- Logic puzzle game

### Summary:

There are sprites/npcs along your journey, with pop-ups of classic video game lines (skyrim style) sometimes with purposeful npc bugs(walk into wall, complaining about not being able to walk somewhere which is accessible, etc.)

Travel through the forest path and town to reach the king.

Solve puzzles to get through your journey fast enough

Possible Results:

- Perfectly healthy

- Suffering

- Dying as you arrive

- Dead on his throne

## Puzzle Ideas for both concepts:

- mazes
	- self explanatory
	- i could try to put with limited visibility though

- hidden signage
	- sign made of trees, must look around to find path
	- more flowers on one side than the other

- trivia about game
	- What was _____ named? (would be on sign or pop-up earlier)
	- What is your goal? (goal of game which would be pretty vague, ex. travel)

- memory challenges
	- how many ____ were on the previous level?
	- where was the _____ located at the start of this level?
