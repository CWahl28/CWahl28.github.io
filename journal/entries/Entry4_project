### Reflection:

The websites I used as refrences for my website are [Bakeshop](https://www.bakeshopva.com),[Heidelberg Pastry Shoppe](https://heidelbergbakery.com), and [Pastries by Randolph](https://pastriesbyrandolph.com). These websites were mostly focused on displaying what their buisness could do, with multiple galleries showcasing all past works. These galleries were well sorted by things such as frosting type or style. Bakeshop was an exeption to that with a menu for cakes and other purchases, and not many examples in one place. I reflected this with my product gallery, which showcases photos of baked goods.

I had some trouble working with wordpress, but I figured it out. This trouble was with figuring out hte difference between templates and pages. I didn't realize they were different things for a while, and got pretty confused. A very helpful thing is how accesible the wordpress forums are for all sorts of things you could be confused by. Something nice in the building process is the patterns, I used patterns on some of my pages to set up the correct format, copy things from one page to another, and improve the visuals of my page.
